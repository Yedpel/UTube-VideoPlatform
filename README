# UTube C++ Server

## Overview
Welcome to the UTube C++ Server branch, a key component of the UTube app developed as part of an Advanced System Programming course at Bar-Ilan University. This repository holds the server-side code that powers our UTube application, which simulates a simplified version of a video streaming service where users can watch, like, and comment on videos.

## Full Project Details
For full details on the entire UTube project, including the Android app, React web app, and Node.js server, please skip this README.md and refer to the wiki pages located inside the cpp_server branch's wiki folder or on the wiki page of the entire repository.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the server locally, follow these steps:

Before compiling, run this command in the terminal to install the required JSON library:
` sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev `

To compile and run the C++ server, use this command in the terminal:
`make && make run`

To stop the server, use Ctrl+C

Additional options:
make        - Compile only
make run    - Run the compiled server
make clean  - Remove compiled files

## Important: Port Availability Check

Before running the services, ensure that port 55551 is available on your system. Follow these steps to check:

### Windows:
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Run the following command:
`netstat -ano | findstr :55551`

3. If there's no output, the port is available.

### Linux/macOS:
1. Open Terminal
2. Run the following command:

`lsof -i :55551`

3. If there's no output, the port is available.

If the port is in use, you may need to choose a different port or close the application using it.

Note: If you change the port, remember to update it in both the :

1) C++ server in main.cpp in the line on top:

`const int SERVER_PORT = 55551;`

2) NodeJS server in services\cppServerService.js in the line on top:

`const CPP_SERVER_PORT = 55551;`
