# UTUBE_Android

Welcome to the UTUBE App repository!
This project was developed as part of the Advanced System Programming course at Bar-Ilan University (BIU).

## Project Team
This application is the result of collaboration among three students: Yedidya, Shimon, and Avraham.
We faced many challenges during the development process but ultimately succeeded in creating a functional and user-friendly application.

## About the App
UTUBE is an application designed for sharing videos, inspired by the popular YouTube platform.
It is developed for both Android and Web platforms. This repository, however, specifically contains the Android part of the application.

## Experience and Challenges
Throughout our journey, we gained valuable experience and encountered numerous challenging problems,
which we managed to overcome with determination and teamwork.

We hope you find this app useful and enjoyable as much as we enjoyed developing it!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Follow these simple steps to get started.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Android Studio installed on your computer.
If not, download and install it from [Android Studio's official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).
